# File-Organizer-using-Python
Organize your Downloads Folder using natural language names 

âœ¨ Ever Tired of a Messy Downloads Folder?

Is your Downloads folder a  messy jungle of random files â€” PDFs, JPEGs, PNGs, IPYNB notebooks, DOCX reports, CSVs, EXEs, and whatnot?



So I built a simple Python script to automatically organize files by type, moving them into neatly named folders like:

Word Document , 

Image File (PNG), 

Python Script, 

CSV File, 

PDF Document

All sorted â€” all in seconds.



ðŸ§  Itâ€™s lightweight, customizable, and can be scheduled to run daily using Windows Task Scheduler ( Inbuilt ) , so your Downloads stay clean forever.

Rest would be ADF, Glue to orchestrate it which comes with some ðŸ’¸.
